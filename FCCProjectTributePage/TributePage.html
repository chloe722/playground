                                    British actor Emma Watson was appointed UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in July 2014. The accomplished actor, humanitarian and
                                    recent graduate of Brown University will dedicate her efforts towards the empowerment
                                    of young women and will serve as an advocate for UN Women’s HeForShe campaign in promoting
                                    gender equality.
                              </p>

                                    At just 24 years of age, Emma has already been involved in the promotion of girls’ education for several years and previously
                                    visited Bangladesh and Zambia as part of her humanitarian efforts. She has worked to
                                    promote fair trade and organic clothing and served as an ambassador for Camfed International,
                                    a movement to educate girls in rural Africa.

                                    “Being asked to serve as UN Women’s Goodwill Ambassador is truly humbling,” said Emma. “The chance to make a real difference
                                    is not an opportunity that everyone is given and is one I have no intention of taking
                                    lightly. Women’s rights are something so inextricably linked with who I am, so deeply
                                    personal and rooted in my life that I can’t imagine an opportunity more exciting. I still
                                    have so much to learn, but as I progress I hope to bring more of my individual knowledge,
                                    experience and awareness to this role.”
